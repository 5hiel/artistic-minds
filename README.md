## 🎮 How It Works

### **AI-Powered Adaptation**
The system continuously learns your cognitive patterns and adapts in real-time:

1. **Behavioral Analysis**: Tracks solving patterns, hesitation, and accuracy
2. **Cognitive Profiling**: Creates unique profile across 5 cognitive dimensions
3. **Smart Selection**: Chooses optimal puzzles with 70-85% prediction accuracy
4. **Flow Optimization**: Maintains perfect challenge-skill balance

### **Power Surge Mechanics**
**60-second challenge windows** with escalating rewards:
- First 5 correct: +1 point each (⚡ building momentum)
- Power surge: 6th = +2, 7th = +3, 8th = +4... (🔥 exponential growth)
- Visual evolution: Theme advances to next mastery level
- Reset triggers: Wrong answer or timer expiration

### **Mastery Progression**
Your visual experience evolves with cognitive growth:

| Mastery Level | Score Range | Visual Theme | Focus |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **Seeker** | 0-9 | Professional Dark | Building foundations |
| **Learner** | 10-99 | Calming Blue | Developing confidence |
| **Thinker** | 100-999 | Energetic Yellow | Active problem-solving |
| **Creator** | 1000-9999 | Creative Pink | Advanced reasoning |
| **Visionary** | 10000+ | Mastery Green | Cognitive excellence |
