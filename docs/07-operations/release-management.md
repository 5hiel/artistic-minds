# Release Management

## ðŸš€ Smart Release Strategy

**Gifted Minds** employs an intelligent release management system that balances rapid delivery with quality assurance through automated decision-making, risk assessment, and staged deployment strategies.

## ðŸ“‹ Release Types & Criteria

### **Daily Releases** (Automated)
- **Trigger**: Code changes detected + quality gates passed + no pending App Store reviews
- **Scope**: Bug fixes, minor features, performance improvements
- **Risk Level**: Low - comprehensive automated testing validation
- **Timeline**: Automatic within 24 hours of merged changes

### **Feature Releases** (Weekly)
- **Trigger**: Major feature completion + comprehensive testing + stakeholder approval
- **Scope**: New puzzle types, major UI changes, significant feature additions
- **Risk Level**: Medium - extended testing period, gradual rollout
- **Timeline**: Planned weekly releases with feature freeze periods

### **Major Releases** (Monthly/Quarterly)
- **Trigger**: Significant architecture changes, major feature sets, platform updates
- **Scope**: System upgrades, new platform support, major algorithm improvements
- **Risk Level**: High - extensive testing, phased deployment, rollback readiness
- **Timeline**: Planned releases with extended validation periods

## ðŸ”„ Release Pipeline

### **Pre-Release Validation**
```bash
# Comprehensive quality validation
npm run quality-check-full    # Lint, typecheck, full test suite, persona validation
npm run performance-test      # Load testing and memory profiling
npm run security-audit        # Dependency and security validation
```

### **App Store Intelligence**
- **Review Status API**: Real-time App Store Connect monitoring
- **Smart Timing**: Optimal submission timing based on review patterns
- **Compliance Checking**: Automated content and metadata validation
- **Risk Assessment**: Historical approval patterns and policy compliance

### **Staged Deployment Strategy**
1. **Internal Testing**: Development team validation
2. **Beta Release**: Limited user group testing (10% of user base)
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Phased deployment (25% â†’ 50% â†’ 100%)
4. **Full Production**: Complete user base deployment

## ðŸ“Š Release Metrics & Success Criteria

### **Quality Gates**
- **Test Coverage**: 70%+ maintained across all modules
- **Performance**: No regression in puzzle generation (<200ms) or UI responsiveness
- **Crash Rate**: <0.1% increase in first 24 hours post-release
- **User Engagement**: No >10% decrease in session duration or frequency

### **Success Metrics**
- **Deployment Success**: 99%+ successful releases without rollback
- **User Adoption**: New features adopted by 30%+ users within 7 days
- **Performance Impact**: <2% performance degradation tolerance
- **User Satisfaction**: Maintained 4.5+ star rating post-release

## ðŸ›  Release Tools & Automation

### **Automated Release Scripts**
```bash
# Daily release orchestration
node scripts/workflows/daily-release/auto-daily-release.js

# Release status monitoring
./scripts/workflows/build-deploy/check-status.sh

# Emergency rollback procedures
./scripts/emergency/manual-rollback.sh --version <stable-version>
```

### **Configuration Management**
- **Environment Variables**: Production, staging, development configurations
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual feature rollout and A/B testing capabilities
- **Version Control**: Semantic versioning with automated changelog generation
- **Rollback Capability**: <5 minute rollback to previous stable version

## ðŸš¨ Risk Management & Rollback

### **Risk Assessment Matrix**
| Change Type | Risk Level | Validation Required | Approval Process |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Bug Fix | Low | Automated Tests | AI Review |
| Minor Feature | Medium | Extended Testing | Team Review |
| Major Feature | High | Full Validation | Stakeholder Approval |
| Architecture | Critical | Comprehensive | Executive Approval |

### **Automated Rollback Triggers**
- **Performance Degradation**: >20% increase in response time
- **Crash Rate Spike**: >0.5% crash rate within first hour
- **User Engagement Drop**: >15% decrease in key engagement metrics
- **Quality Gate Failure**: Post-deployment validation failures

## ðŸ“… Release Calendar & Planning

### **Regular Release Schedule**
- **Daily**: Automated releases for qualified changes
- **Weekly**: Feature releases every Tuesday (planned)
- **Monthly**: Major releases first Monday of month
- **Quarterly**: Platform and architecture updates

### **Special Release Events**
- **Hot Fixes**: Emergency releases within 2-4 hours
- **App Store Events**: Coordinated releases for App Store features
- **Platform Updates**: iOS/Android platform compatibility releases
- **Seasonal Releases**: Holiday themes and special events
