## 🎮 Product Principles

### **Adaptive First**
Every interaction should inform and improve the user's experience. The system learns continuously to provide optimal challenge and engagement.

### **Scientifically Grounded**
All cognitive assessments and difficulty progressions are based on established cognitive development research and validated through persona testing.

### **Inclusive Design**
Support learners across all ages, cognitive abilities, and learning styles. No user should feel excluded or overwhelmed.

### **Quality Over Quantity**
Better to have fewer, exceptional puzzle types than many mediocre ones. Each puzzle type should serve a clear cognitive purpose.

### **Transparent Intelligence**
Users should understand why they're being challenged and see their progress clearly. AI intelligence enhances rather than obscures the learning experience.
