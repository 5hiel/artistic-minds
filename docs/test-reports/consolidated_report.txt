### 2. PERFORMANCE EVOLUTION ACROSS PERSONAS
📊 **Final Accuracy Progression**:
- Ma (chunks 1-5): 72.0% (steady performer)
- omi (chunks 6-10): 80.0% (highest accuracy, pattern-focused)
- mumu (chunks 11-15): Not displayed in logs
- ira (chunks 16-20): 30.0% (lowest accuracy, competitive but struggling)

📈 **Skill Level Transitions**:
- Ma: 0.76 (experienced baseline)
- omi: 0.55 (child-appropriate, excellent pattern recognition 0.79)
- mumu: Not captured in logs
- ira: 0.50 (child level, pattern recognition 0.78)

### 3. DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION ADAPTATION

**Ma (60-year-old)**:
- EASY: 70% average | HARD: 30% average
- Consistent adult-level challenge

**omi (5-year-old)**:
- EASY: 10%→80% progression (adaptive correction)
- HARD: 90%→20% reduction (constraint violation response)
- Engine detected age mismatch and corrected

**ira (8-year-old)**:
- EASY: 30%→40% | HARD: 70%→60%
- Maintained challenging puzzles appropriate for competitive nature

### 4. PUZZLE TYPE PREFERENCES & ADAPTATION

**Ma**: Balanced across pattern, number series, serial reasoning, algebraic reasoning
**omi**: Strong pattern focus (0.79 preference score), struggled with algebraic reasoning (0/2)
**ira**: Excellent pattern recognition (0.78), poor algebraic reasoning performance (1/3)

🚨 **Critical Finding**: Engine initially served hard puzzles (90%) but adapted:
- EASY puzzles increased: 10% → 80%
- HARD puzzles decreased: 90% → 20%
- Demonstrates real-time constraint violation detection and correction

📊 **Puzzle Strengths**:
- pattern: 13/15 (87% success) - core strength
- serial reasoning: 7/8 (88% success)
- algebraic reasoning: 0/4 (0% success) - age-appropriate limitation

### IRA PERSONA ANALYSIS (Chunks 16-20) - COMPETITIVE CHILD RESPONSE
🎯 **Profile**: 8-year-old competitive child with pattern skills
📈 **Performance**:
- Overall Accuracy: 30.0% (lowest - indicates challenge level)
- Skill Level: 0.50 (child-appropriate)
- Pattern Recognition: ✅ EXCELLENT (0.78)

⚖️ **Difficulty**: Maintained challenging distribution:
- EASY: 30-40% | HARD: 60-70%
- Engine recognized competitive nature, maintained difficulty

📊 **Puzzle Performance**:
- pattern: 12/16 (75% success) - maintained strength
- number series: 1/4 (25% success) - struggling with sequence logic
- algebraic reasoning: 1/10 (10% success) - age-appropriate difficulty

=================================================================================
## 🔬 ADAPTIVE ENGINE ANALYSIS

### STRENGTHS DISCOVERED:
✅ **Age Detection & Constraint Enforcement**: Successfully detected omi's age limitations
✅ **Real-time Adaptation**: Corrected hard puzzle serving to 5-year-old mid-session
✅ **Persona Recognition**: Maintained appropriate challenge for competitive ira
✅ **Pattern Consistency**: All child personas showed excellent pattern recognition
✅ **Skill Level Calibration**: Appropriate skill levels for different age groups

### AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
⚠️ **Initial Constraint Violation**: Hard puzzles initially served to 5-year-old
⚠️ **Performance Consistency**: Large variation in accuracy (30%-80%)
⚠️ **Algebraic Reasoning**: Universally challenging across child personas

### BEHAVIORAL ADAPTATIONS OBSERVED:
1. **60→5 year transition**: Immediate difficulty reduction, constraint activation
2. **5→25 year transition**: Not fully captured in logs
3. **25→8 year transition**: Maintained challenge level for competitive child
4. **Cross-session persistence**: Engine maintained session state across persona switches

=================================================================================
## 🎯 CONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS
