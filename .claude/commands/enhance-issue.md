# GitHub Issue Enhancement

Analyze GitHub issue $1 and enhance it by updating the issue description with comprehensive requirements and testing scenarios.

## Process Instructions:
1. First, fetch the current issue details using `gh issue view $1`
2. Analyze the existing description and identify what's missing or unclear
3. Create enhanced content focusing on WHAT needs to be done, not HOW
4. Use `gh issue edit $1 --body "ENHANCED_CONTENT"` to update the issue description
5. Add a comment confirming the enhancement was completed

## Enhanced Content Structure:

### Original Description
[Keep the original user description intact at the top]

---

### Detailed Requirements
- Clarify ambiguous or incomplete requirements
- Break down complex features into specific, measurable deliverables
- Define exact behavior expectations for each component
- Specify data requirements, formats, and validation rules
- List all user interactions and system responses

### Integration Requirements  
- Identify all systems, components, or APIs that must be integrated
- Specify how the feature should interact with existing functionality
- Define data flow between different parts of the system
- List any configuration or setup requirements

### Testing Scenarios

#### Positive Test Cases
- Define happy path scenarios with expected outcomes
- List all valid input combinations and expected results
- Specify performance benchmarks and acceptance thresholds

#### Negative Test Cases & Edge Cases
- Invalid inputs and error handling requirements
- Boundary conditions and limit testing
- Network failures, timeouts, and connectivity issues
- Memory constraints and resource limitations
- Race conditions and concurrent access scenarios
- Data corruption and recovery scenarios
- Permission denied and authentication failures
- Configuration errors and missing dependencies

#### Platform-Specific Scenarios
- iOS-specific behaviors and constraints
- Android-specific behaviors and constraints  
- Web browser compatibility and limitations
- Device orientation changes and screen size variations
- Accessibility requirements for screen readers and assistive technology

### Acceptance Criteria
- Define clear, testable success criteria using "Given/When/Then" format
- Specify measurable performance requirements
- List all UI/UX requirements with specific interactions
- Define compatibility requirements across platforms
- Specify security and privacy requirements

### Definition of Done
- List all deliverables that must be completed
- Specify testing coverage requirements
- Define documentation requirements
- List review and approval requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Always use `gh issue edit $1 --body "$(cat <<'EOF' ... EOF)"` to update the issue description, not comments. Focus on requirements clarification and comprehensive testing scenarios, NOT implementation details or code examples.
