# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Gifted Minds** is an intelligent adaptive puzzle platform that grows with you - featuring AI-powered puzzle selection, **9+ distinct puzzle types** with 35+ subtypes covering cognitive reasoning, pattern recognition, mathematical relationships, and spatial transformations. The platform provides personalized learning experiences for ages 4-65+ through sophisticated behavioral learning algorithms, power surge mechanics, and autonomous development workflows.

### Product Context
- **Market Position**: First truly adaptive cognitive training platform with real-time AI learning
- **User Base**: Cross-generational (4-65+ years) with persona validation (Ira 8y, Omi 5y, Mumu 25y, Ma 60y)
- **Business Value**: Educational technology with B2C/B2B markets, institutional licensing potential
- **Technical Excellence**: 200+ tests, 70%+ coverage, TypeScript strict, autonomous AI-powered development

## Quick Start Commands

### Development
```bash
npm start                    # Start Expo development server
npm run quality-check        # Run complete CI validation (lint + typecheck + tests)
npm test                     # Run all tests (200+ tests, 70%+ coverage)
npm run lint                 # ESLint code quality checks
npm run typecheck            # TypeScript type checking
```

### Platform Testing
```bash
npm run ios                  # iOS simulator
npm run android              # Android emulator
npm run web                  # Web browser
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
npx eas build                # Production binaries
npx eas submit               # Submit to app stores
```

### Quality Assurance (REQUIRED before commits)
```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
```

## Persona Testing Framework

ðŸ“‹ **Complete persona testing documentation has been moved to [`PERSONA_TESTING.md`](./PERSONA_TESTING.md)**

For all persona testing instructions, troubleshooting, and advanced configurations, refer to the dedicated documentation:

### Quick Reference
```bash
# Single persona test (most common)
PRESET=quick PERSONA=ira npm run test:personas -- --testNamePattern="Enhanced configurable" --testTimeout=600000

# For complete instructions, cross-persona testing, troubleshooting, and advanced options:
# See PERSONA_TESTING.md
```

**Available Personas**: `ira` (8y), `omi` (5y), `mumu` (25y), `ma` (60y)
**Documentation**: All testing procedures â†’ [`PERSONA_TESTING.md`](./PERSONA_TESTING.md)
