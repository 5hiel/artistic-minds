This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Artistic Minds** is an innovative Tetris Art Generator that transforms classic puzzle gameplay into creative expression - featuring adaptive AI-powered shape selection, **infinite abstract art generation** with organic curves, geometric patterns, and artistic brushstrokes. Players create unique artworks through Tetris-style gameplay, then share their masterpieces with the world through an integrated social platform.

### Product Context
- **Market Position**: First Tetris-style game that generates shareable abstract art through gameplay
- **User Base**: Creative minds of all ages (8-65+) seeking artistic expression through gaming
- **Business Value**: Gaming + Art creation platform with B2C markets, NFT potential, print-on-demand integration
- **Technical Excellence**: Built on proven Gifted Minds foundation with 200+ tests, 70%+ coverage, TypeScript strict

## Quick Start Commands

### Development
```bash
npm start                    # Start Expo development server
npm run quality-check        # Run complete CI validation (lint + typecheck + tests)
npm test                     # Run all tests (200+ tests, 70%+ coverage)
npm run lint                 # ESLint code quality checks
npm run typecheck            # TypeScript type checking
```

### Platform Testing
```bash
npm run ios                  # iOS simulator
npm run android              # Android emulator
npm run web                  # Web browser
```

### Build & Deploy
```bash
npx eas build                # Production binaries
npx eas submit               # Submit to app stores
```

### Quality Assurance (REQUIRED before commits)
```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm test
```

## Art Generation System

### Core Gameplay
- **Tetris-Style Mechanics**: Classic falling pieces with artistic twist
- **Infinite Shape Variety**: Organic curves, geometric patterns, brushstrokes
- **Art Creation**: Each game generates unique abstract artwork
- **Social Sharing**: High-res export, gallery system, community features

### Shape Libraries
**Organic Forms**: Sine waves, spirals, leaf shapes, natural elements
**Geometric Abstractions**: Sacred geometry, architectural elements, crystal formations
**Artistic Brushstrokes**: Watercolor blobs, calligraphy, paint textures
**Cultural Patterns**: Art movements, cultural aesthetics, themed collections
